Beautiful In White By Westlife

Not sure if you know this
But when we first met
I got so nervous I couldn't speak
In that very moment I found the one And
my life had found its missing piece

So as long as I live I love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now till my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white, tonight

What we have is timeless
My love is endless
And with this ring I say to the world
You're my every reason you're all
That I believe in with all my heart
I mean every word

So as long as I live I love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now till my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white, tonight

Ooh, oh
You look so beautiful in white

Na, na, na, na

So beautiful in white, tonight

And if a daughter's what our future holds
I hope she has your eyes
Finds love like you and I did
Yeah, i wish she falls in love we'll let her go
I'll walk her down the aisle
She'll look so beautiful in white

You look so beautiful in white

So as long as I live I love you
Will heaven hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now till my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white, tonight

You look so beautiful in white, tonight
